# Works

My projects in research, composition, and criticism are situated at the
intersection of language and its social and cultural effects. They have
included research on the effects of social identity on speech and
writing as well as literary analysis of works with an eye towards social
issues.

them instead of only teaching non-queer students to respect others.

compared to linguistic features of the adjectives.

inescapability of capitalism in modern Japan using the theories of Mark Fisher and
Jacques Derrida.

## Imaginary Portals and Oppressive Technologies

In this essay, I analyzed the effects of modern technologies in the novel Exit West by Mohsin Hamid. From mobile phones to surveillance, I argued that these technologies are used to support and oppress both the characters in the novel and real-life migrants.
