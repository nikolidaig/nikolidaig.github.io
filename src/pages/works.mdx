# Works

My projects in research, composition, and criticism are situated at the
intersection of language and its social and cultural effects. They have
included research on the effects of social identity on speech and
writing as well as literary analysis of works with an eye towards social
issues.

## Inescapable Capitalism in _Tokyo Ueno Station_

In this paper, I showed how Yū Miri's 2014 novel _Tokyo Ueno Station_ emphasizes the
inescapability of capitalism in modern Japan using the theories of Mark Fisher and
Jacques Derrida.

## Queer Pedagogies & Queer Composition

In this study, I surveyed queer students and argued that pedagogies sometimes falls
short in supporting them in the classroom. I proposed that instructors should focus on
them instead of only teaching non-queer students to respect others.

## Imaginary Portals and Oppressive Technologies in _Exit West_

In this essay, I analyzed the effects of modern technologies in the novel Exit West by Mohsin Hamid.
From mobile phones to surveillance, I argued that these technologies are used to support and oppress
both the characters in the novel and real-life migrants.
