            My projects in research, composition, and criticism are situated at the intersection of language and its
            social and cultural effects. They have included research on the effects of social identity on speech and
            writing as well as literary analysis of works with an eye towards social issues.

            <span slot="description">
                In this paper, I showed how Yū Miri’s 2014 novel <cite>Tokyo Ueno Station</cite> emphasizes the
                inescapability of capitalism in modern Japan using the theories of Mark Fisher and Jacques Derrida.

            <span slot="description">
                In class-wide research project, speakers of African American English were surveyed to find the rates of
                progressive <em>-s</em> absence in their speech. The results were analyzed against demographic
                information about the speakers and past research.

                This essay explores the politicization of language in response to Min-Zhan Lu’s essay “From Silence to
                Words,” in which Lu reflected on her English education in 1950s China.

            <span slot="description">
                In this study, I surveyed queer students and argued that pedagogies sometimes falls short in supporting
                them in the classroom. I proposed that instructors should focus on them instead of only teaching
                non-queer students to respect others

            <span slot="description">
                In this essay, I analyzed the effects of modern technologies in the novel <cite>Exit West</cite> by
                Mohsin Hamid. From mobile phones to surveillance, I argued that these technologies are used to support
                and oppress both the characters in the novel and real-life migrants.
